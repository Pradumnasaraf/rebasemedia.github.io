        <ol>
            <li>
                To calculate the fees, visit <a href="https://smallseotools.com/paypal-fee-calculator/">https://smallseotools.com/paypal-fee-calculator/</a> and locate the section shown in the image below. This PayPal calculator is the most accurate one I've found so far. I have encountered inaccuracies with others in the past, as they don't offer flexibility in choosing the Fee Rate.

            <li>
                Enter the amount in USD, in this case, $1000, and select the Fee Rate as 6.5% + $0.05 USD. Then, click on Calculate. This is the current fee rate for international micro payments. You can also verify the fee rate on the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/in/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees">PayPal website</a> under Micropayments section. You will also find information in the dropdown menu. If the calculator is not working, please contact us.

            <li>
                After clicking Calculate, you will see the amount to send under "You should ask for," which, in this case, is $1069.57 USD. This is the amount you should transfer to the PayPal account.
